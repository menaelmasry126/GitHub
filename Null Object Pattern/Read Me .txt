According to my research, and my understanding from the information I found, the null object is bascially an object replacing the null check in the code. Therefore, in the code
provided I attempted to show that the "NullObjectivepattern" will be extended from the mother class which is "Shipment" in this case. The class will check if the status is 
available, in the case where the status is not available or "null" it will send back a "Shipment status is not avaialble", and if it is available it will send back a true.
